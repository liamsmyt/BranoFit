                    disillusioned. But Jack has a as taught me so much about
                    nutrition, consistency and fuelling my body in a way that
                    makes it not only perform better but feel better. I
                    genuinely didn't think I had it in me until I started
                    working with Jack. He completely reassured me and put my
                    mind at ease. Jack is motivational, empathetic and has a
                    wicked sense of humour he make me feel completely at ease
                    and showed me that I was able to achieve my goals. Even as I
                    continue my journey I know I am in the safest of hands. If

                    personal trainer Jack Brannigan, and the results have been
                    nothing short of remarkable. Jack's holistic approach was a
                    game-changer, seamlessly integrating my fitness goals with
                    the realities of daily life-holidays, special occasions, and
                    all. Rather than waiting for the 'right time' to start, Jack
                    taught me that the best time is now, with a plan tailored to
                    fit my lifestyle, not the other way around. Over 12 weeks,
                    I've not only lost over 8kg but did so while maintaining my
                    muscle mass, a testament to Jack's expertise. His guidance
                    has been invaluable, turning my 'fuck it' button into a
                    source of strength and perseverance. I'm excited to embark
                    on another 12 weeks with Jack as my accountability coach. If
                    you're looking to make a lasting change that fits your life,

                    weren't right or i didnt get the steps and I got frustrated,
                    you never gave up on me and never let me be hard on myself
                    and I so appreciate that. The proof was in the pudding as
                    they say and I'm absolutely thrilled with the results on the
                    body scan and the direction things are going. It was a great
                    tool because if it allowed me to see progress and change
                    that isn't about the scales and it also taught me that I
                    can't always see change and that's when trusting the process
                    is vital. So thank you and I can't wait to see where we are
                    in 12 weeks time :)"

                    "Where do I start?? I was stuck in a rut after having my
                    little girl, with having no confidence and needing some
                    help, I heard of a new class starting in Milltown. So I
                    attended Jack's class for a couple of weeks and decided to
                    do PT with him. Jack makes you feel very comfortable, he is
                    very encouraging and very determined for me to do my best.
                    Jack is very patient, respectful, supportive, trusting and
                    overall a lovely fella. My PT starts at 6am I never have a
                    problem hopping out of bed, class is tough but Jack makes it
                    enjoyable and is very supportive of me meeting my goals. I
                    have noticed my mindset is different, I have more energy,
                    I've lost some weight and I can see my body toning up.
                    Overall I feel very confident in myself. I am loving how my
                    journey is going so far and looking forward to my end goal.
                    I would highly recommend Jack he is a fantastic coach and
                    always wants the best for his clients"

                    class, which was my main aim and my fitness has improved

                    way to go if you really want results give him a look up you
                    won't be disappointed, I'm loving it."

                    Fitter. Faster. Stronger. Accountable. Motivated. After two
                    months sitting around post foot surgery I found it so hard
                    to get myself back into a good routine and "back on track",
                    after chatting to Jack I knew he was the person for me to
                    achieve my targets of improved technique, getting nutrition
                    back on track, feeling motivated and one I thought I'd never
                    achieve doing is a handstand! The weeks have flown by and
                    every week we've had subtle check ins to make sure I'm on
                    track and sticking to the plan! Jack set a plan in place for
                    me that was achievable but more importantly also specific to
                    what I wanted to achieve! I cannot recommend Jack enough,
                    each week my technique has improved, overall my love of the
                    gym has improved and my personal accountability and
                    acceptance for when the plan doesn't always fit the reality
                    has improved!"
